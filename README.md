# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Graph API for retrieving the metadata and body of Outlook and Microsoft calendar



In this project, I am retrieving the data from Outlook and the calendar of the user. So here are the following steps by which I achieved  that

Authenticate the user using MSAL.

I authenticate the user using MSAL I implemented login and logout functionality for the user in that process I stored the access token of the user so that I can retrieve their data.



Metadata and event body of the  Calendar:

I hit this endpoint to retrieve the metadata and event body of the calendar. https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events





Metadata and event body of the  of the Outlook:

For achieving this milestone I hit this endpoints 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$select=id,subject,body,sender,toRecipients'







Here you can see all those results in the console as well.



For retrieving all these data I used the React.js framework.

#For run this application 
1 clone the repo and do npm I
2. After that just do npm start.

>>>>>>> origin/main
